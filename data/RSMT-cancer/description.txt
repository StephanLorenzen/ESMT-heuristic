The instances are derived from a problem in cancer genomics to model
the progression of genetic changes in a solid tumor. In a normal cell,
each gene on the numbered chromosomes 1-22 has two copies. One of the
types of genetic changes observed in cancer cells is that the copy
numbers of genes can increase to > 2 to decrease to < 2. Multi-color
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used to measure
simultaneously the copy numbers of multiple genes in a single cell.
If data are collected on dozens or hundreds of cells in the same
tumor, then one can model the progression of copy number changes from
the normal all-2 state.  Chowdhury et al. (Bioinformatics 29(2013),
pp. i189-i198) showed how to reduce the problem of modeling tumor
progression to an instance of the Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree
(RSMT) problem. The instances are derived from published data on breast 
cancer, (Heselmeyer-Haddad et al., American Journal of Pathology
181(2012), pp. 1807-1822), and prostate cancer (Heselmeyer-Haddad 
et al., American Journal of Pathology, to appear in the October 2014 
issue). Each point in d-dimensional space (in these instances d = 4,
d = 6, and d = 8), represents the numbers of copies of d genes observed 
simultaneously in at least one cell of the tumor. The directed Steiner 
tree rooted at the all-2 state shows one model for how genomic changes 
in the tumor may have progressed.
